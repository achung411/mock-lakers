	<h3>The Lakers badly need to add some talent next season...</h3>
	<p>Who might the dynamic duo of Mitch & Jim target?  How about the one and only Neo?  After all, no rules can hold him down...  and with all of his tremendous gifts, he may even unseat Kobe as the greatest Laker of the modern era...  Pair him with rookie phenom to be, Dante Exum, and impending future free agent acquisition Kevin Love alongside one final career year from Kobe Bryant (and a glorious whimper of a farewell tour in Steve Nash), and we may be seeing the next NBA dynasty.</p>
